    "## Customization Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool offers a basic range of customization features, empowering users to tailor the content and formatting of the generated DOCX files. Key customization options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Heading:**\n",
    "  - Insert headings at different levels to organize the content effectively.\n",
    "  - Customize heading levels according to the report structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add text:**\n",
    "  - Incorporate additional text paragraphs to provide context, explanations, or other relevant information within the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Bullet Points:**\n",
    "  - Insert bullet points to highlight key information.\n",
    "  - Customize bullet points to create numbered lists for sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Figure:**\n",
    "  - Embed figures (images) into the document to enhance visual representation.\n",
    "  - Specify figure headings for clarity.\n",
    "  - Customize figure dimensions, including width and height, for optimal presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Table:**\n",
    "  - Integrate tables into the document directly from CSV files.\n",
    "  - Include table headings to provide context and structure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Add Metadata:**\n",
    "  - Define additional details to be incorporated into the generated reports, such as timestamps, author names, or test configuration parameters.\n",
